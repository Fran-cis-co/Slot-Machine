## Slot Machine in Python

A text-based slot machine created in python.

It is not the most balanced slot machine, however for the purpose of a project to develop my skills in python I think it is fine.

The user will be asked how much they want to deposit, how many lines of the slot machine they want to spin, and how much they want to bet. The program ensures the user does not bet beyond what available balance they have.

For this project the machine is displayed as a 3x3 matrix and depending on how many lines they want to bet on is how many rows the program will check.
